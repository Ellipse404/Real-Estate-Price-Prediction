# Real-Estate-Price-Prediction
As its a Real Life problem demonstrated with Machine Learning using Python 3
Based on the data-set we provide, it gives the result. The more consistent data is the low Accuracy it gives. I've tried various ways to remove consistency in data-set.
In each necessary step data-set is visualized for better understanding.
Usage :
  Simply you can run the cells one after another till last cell and it'll return result.
   You can change the data-set by importing seperate data (data should be in .csv file)
at the very first line after importing modules/lib
  Command : data = pd.read("Your data-set.csv")
N.B : the data should be in the same directories under same folder.
based on your data-set consistency the model may give different Accuracy.

Treating Missing Values :
   Based on your data-set size you can change the way of treating missing values.
Algorithm :
  I have used Gradient Descent Algorithm, one of the Algorithms out there for Linear   Regression. You can use one of them
